# Eynsham (First Energy Model)

This repository contains code for the first energy model in the Eynsham P&R 3YP project.

The energy demand is based purely on Pear Tree P&R data, whereas the energy management algorithm implemented by Linh accounts for different scenarios. The energy generation and deficit remains the same for both repositories.

# Energy Demand Profiles

The first sheet of spreadsheet x contains information from Pear Tree P&R. The energy demand was calculated in Excel. Formulas can be examined by selecting the relevant cell in each column. The total energy demand was copied into the text files titled x to be used in Python.

Script x shows blah

# Energy Generation Profiles

Script x produces an hourly energy generation profile across one year, based on averaged PVGIS solar irradiance data found in spreadsheet x.

# Energy Deficit Profiles
